    <!-- ==================== Synchronous JS

        ex : alert()
     -->

    <!-- =================== Asynchronous JS
        ex: fetch
     -->

    <!-- ================== Async Callbacks
        - called back when previous task is finished
        - not all callbacks are asynchronous (forEach)
     -->
    
    <!-- =================== Promises -->
    <!-- =================== Event Queue
        - promises put into this queue
    
     -->

    <!-- ===================== Promises vs Callback -->


    <!-- =============  Conclusion  ============
        - JS in Single Threaded and Synchronous
        - with the help of event queue it act as asynchronous
